# Complete multiply.c

Prompt a user for input of a number between 1-10 inclusively.
Use a for loop with 10 iterations to multiply the number entered 
by the user with your initialized counter for each iteration. Make sure
the output generated by your program looks exactly as the example in '[' brackets as 
below.
~~~ 
Input = 1;
Output = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
