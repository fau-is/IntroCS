# Initials

Write a program initials.c that takes a user’s full name as input, and outputs their initials.

Specs:
- The program should accept a user’s name using  ’get_string’
- Initials should all be printed as uppercase letters, even if the name contains lowercase letters
- Students can assume that the user’s names will be separated by one space

Hints:
- Combine loops and conditions
- A variable can be used as an indicator for following iterations
- Access string characters with s[i]
- Use ’ctype.h’ functions toupper(char c)
