# Palindrome

Write a program palindrome.c that takes a string as input, and determines whether it is a palindrome. This can often be a useful follow-up to reverse.c

Hints:
- One ‘for’ loop suffices to solve this task
- strlen(s) gets the length of a string
- The length of an array is always one larger than the largest index.
