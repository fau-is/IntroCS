# Problem Set 7
## Object-Oriented Programming with Mastodon 

### Week 1 of Group work:

This weeks problem set is going to a group work. Collaboration between groups is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you, per the courseâ€™s policy on [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/). Every group member should contribute to solve the problem set and write some of the submission code, since it is relevant for the exam anyhow. The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to be in violation of this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.
