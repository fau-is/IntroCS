# Week 2: Understanding Relationships with Graphs and Trees
## Objective
To help students understand graphs and trees as well as their benefits using the relationships between different users, posts, retweets, and favourites.
## Tasks
1. Understanding Graphs & Trees: Students will receive a lecture about the basic concepts.
2. Graph Implementation: Students will design a graph where nodes represent the entities (users, posts, retweets, favourites), and edges represent the relationships between these entities.
3. Tree Implementation: Students will also create a binary tree for storing retweets efficiently. Each retweet can be stored in the binary tree using the alphabetical order of the user who retweeted.
4. Traversal Algorithms: Students will implement and understand various graph and tree traversal algorithms such as Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversal.
5. Performance Analysis: Students will analyse the time and space complexity of their implementations. They will also discuss the efficiency and real-world applicability of their chosen data structures.
