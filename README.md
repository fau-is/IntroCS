# Week 1: Object-Oriented Programming with Mastodon API
## Objective
To familiarize students with the Mastodon API and the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Students will access the API data and store users, posts, retweets, and favourites as objects.
## Tasks
1. Learning about the Mastodon API: Students will receive general instructions about OOP as well as APIs and the basics of Mastodon to understand how to interact with it.
2. Accessing Data via the API: Students will write Python code (or a language of your choice that supports OOP) to access data from the Mastodon API.
3. Creating Objects: Students will create classes for Users, Posts, Retweets, and favourites. Instances of these classes will be created using data obtained from the Mastodon API.
4. Problem-Solving Exercises: Students will work in groups to complete a problem set designed to enhance their understanding and usage of OOP concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
5. Data Storage: Students will create methods for storing and retrieving these objects, simulating a simple database.
