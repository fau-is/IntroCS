# Conditions in C
Write a program calc.c that gets two integers a and b from a user. Create an integer result:
- If a is greater than b, subtract b from a (a - b)
- If a is lower than b, sum a and b (a + b)
- If a and b are equal, multiply a and b (a * b)

Print the result as follows:

>	printf(“a: %i; b: %i; result: %i\n”, a, b, result);
