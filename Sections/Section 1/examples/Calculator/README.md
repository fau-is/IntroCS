# Let's have a look at a very basic program: A calculator

## Intro
If we combine loops, functions and getting input from users, we can create a first program.
For now, let's not argue about usefulness ;).

## Functionality
In every loop, the program will ask which calculator operation should be executed. Depending on a user's input a function is called:
- sum
- modulo
- multiply
- division

After performing the calculation the result is printed.
