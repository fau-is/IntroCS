# Graph Drawing
## Lab Setup
Before we start hacking, you need to execute a few commands:
´´´
sudo apt install graphviz
pip install graphviz
´´´
If prompted whether you want to use up more space just type 'y' and hit Enter. Don't worry about any warnings.
To test if the installation worked, run:
´´´
python graph_drawer.py
´´´
If no error shows up, you're good to go!

{% next "Lab Setting" %}

Imagine, after finishing IntroCS successfully you apply for an internship at a large software vendor "Geeglo".
"Geeglo" likes to ask algorithmic questions in job interviews.
As you arrive for your interview, they ask you to write a function which determines if a graph is undirected or directed.
The graph is encoded as a Python graph.
The lab provided comes with three files:
- symmetry.py => This is where you need to add your symmetry check.
- symmetry_test.py => Unit-test cases for the function you need to write
- graph_drawer.py => Should, in the end, draw an undirected graph.
