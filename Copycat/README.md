# Complete copycat.c

## Copycat
Your task is simple! Read in a file ("original.txt") and copy its contents to another file
("copy.txt").

For this exercise, you must be familiar with the functions introduced by CS50 included
in FILE I/O. If you are unsure where to start have a look at the functions included in the
stdio.h library

## Program Specifications
For this exercise, you are on your own! There is no distribution. 
The only thing you are given are the files you need to work with: 

1. **copycat.c** - this is your program file where you will do all of your programming.
2. **original.txt** - this is your input .txt file which you are required to read in
3. **copy.txt** - this is you output .txt. file which you will write into


You are free to take in arguments via the command line or via CS50s offered functions.
You don't even have to take any input. However, remember this is generally not advised as
you want your programs to behave dynamically.

**The only thing that matters is for you to copy the text in the original file exactly 
the way it is to the copy file.**


**Have fun coding!**

## Libraries

You find functions that will help you with this task in the *stdio.h* library.
Other than that all the libraries you need are included in the header already.

If you don't know which library contains what function, you find a plethora of documentation for C 
libraries in the actual CS50 documentation, GeekForGeeks, and W3Schools.
