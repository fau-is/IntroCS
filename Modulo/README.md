# Complete modulo.c

Write a program that prompts a user for an integer input using a function such as get_int(). The program
you write should then check whether or not the entered number is in actual fact an uneven or an uneven number.

~~~
Example: 
$ ./modulo
Input = 2 
2 is an even number!
$
$./modulo
Input = 3
3 is an uneven number!
$
~~~

Modulo is helpful here. Try thinking back at the mathematical properties of the modulo and 
how you can utilize it.

We have included some basic checks for you to see whether your program works in the intended way.
You can run this command in your Terminal to run the check

$check50 fau-is/IntroCS/Pset1/Modulo --local
