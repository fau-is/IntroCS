# Polymorphism




## Method Overloading
Method overloading refers to functions with the same name, but different parameters.
It usually results in different functionalities.

Create a function sum that can sum up at leas two and up to four numbers at the same time.

## Method Overriding
Open override.py, and implement three subclasses of Item:
* FoodItem => A food item is taxed with 7%.
* NonFoodItem => A non-food item is taxed 16%.
* SpecialOfferItem => “50% off”-offer; it is taxed 19%.

Override the method price() in each of the sub_classes to take care of the above mentioned specifications.
