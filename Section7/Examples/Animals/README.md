# Animals example

This file is an implementation of the lecture's animal example. Feel free to play around with the sources and see how you could change the behaviour.


# Task
Add a class _Parrot_ that inherits from _Bird_, and reimplement the function speak to receive a parameter string. A parrot can speak whatever you want it to speak.
