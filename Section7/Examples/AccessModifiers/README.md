# Demonstration of access modifieres
Python features access modifiers for its objects.
In general, there are three access modifiers for attributes:
* Private: indicated by a double underscore self.__value Private attributes cannot be accessed from outside a class.
* Protected: Indicated by a single underscore self._value Protected attributes should not be accessed from outside a class, other than sub-classes. Note that Python only sets this as convention, so protected is more an indicator for you.
* Public: Indicated by the absence of an underscore: self.value Public attributes are always accessible.

## Executing access_modifiers.py
Have a look at the right, see what the results of the different print statements are.
