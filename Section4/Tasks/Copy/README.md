# Copy
Write a program that copies a text file. Users should be able to run

$ ./copy file1 file2

to copy the contents of a text-file file1 into file file2.

To practice, two extensions of the program might be *copy_upper.c* and *copy_caesar.c*

In *copy_upper.c*, write a program which copies all text from file1 to file2, whereby it writes all characters in upper case into file2.

In *copy_caesar.c*, write a program that encrypts file1 using caesar with any key of your choice. The encrypted file should be file2.
