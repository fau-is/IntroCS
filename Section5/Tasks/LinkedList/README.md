# Linked Lists

In this program, implement a linked list which reads some numbers from a text-file.
Reading is already implemented as you can see.

## Functions of data structures

Functions that you should implement:
- _create_
    - creates a node of a linked list
- _add_
    - adds a node to an existing list
- _size_
    - determines the number of nodes in a linked list
- _delete_
    - deletes the entire linked list.
- _find_
    - returns true if element is present and false otherwise


## Differences in add
First, try to implement a linked list, where every new element is added the the beginning of the list.

Second, implement a linked list where every new element is added to the end of a linked list.

Lastly, implement a linked list where every new element is added so that the resulting linked list is sorted.
