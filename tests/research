What is a unittest?
partial testing of your code


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI 

running test without main: $ python -m test_loadtoots.py

functions need to be started with the word "test" 
(for count of the ran tests)

setUp runs before every single test
tearDown methods runs after every single test (for adding file to directory and deleting it after words)


isolate test from each other since they run in different orders
--> maybe once before everything and once after everything "@classmehtod" setupClass /teardownClass



test-driven-developement = writing test before you write the code 
--> code must fulfill requirements (pass the test)
